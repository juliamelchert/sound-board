# Sound Board
*Author: Julia Melchert | Date Last Updated: 9/28/2022*

This application allows users to create a personalized sound board. Upon registration, users are given sample audios that can be played with the click of a button.
From there, users can add their own mp3 audios to their sound board and easily access them by simply logging back in. This project utilizes **Flask**, **SQLite**,
and **Jinja2**.

This website can be run locally by running the following command in the **'sound-board'** directory:
```
flask --app main --debug run
```

*Please note that this project is a work in progress.*
